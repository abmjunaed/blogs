# You should ask good question at the end of the interview

**At the end of the interview, the interviewer will ask you, "Do you have any questions for us?" Unfortunately, many people just say that "No, I don't have any question," or they ask some very trivial one or two questions, but that's not good. You should have some questions prepared.** 

There are several reasons for this

**1. Remove their doubt!**

The number one reason is to prove once again that you have all the qualities for this job. Even if you had that discussion, you had a one-hour-long interview; the interviewer might not have complete confidence in you. You should ask some questions, and with the answer to those questions.

**2.To find out some essential qualifications and to show that you have those**

I'll show you which questions to ask them and answer in a way so that you can prove that you have those core skills!

**3. To decide if you want to join this company if you get an offer!**

Another thing is, if you get a job offer from this company, you have to decide whether you will join this company or not. Is it a good match for your career path? You also have to get a lot more information about themselves. You should ask a couple of questions to understand: does this company match your career plan or not? I'll show you which questions to ask in my course in detail.
