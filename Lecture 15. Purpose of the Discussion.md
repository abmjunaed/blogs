# How to interview your interviewer and Purpose of the Discussion in a Job Interview a
One stage of Junaed's powerful framework for job interviews was "Discussion". Today, we will see the purpose of the discussion. 
Let's start. 

### To know which skills are really important
The first purpose is to know which skills are really important for this job. Because sometimes, the job description is really vague. Sometimes, the job description mentions a lot of skills, and during the interview, you can't focus on all the skills they mentioned. 
So first, you need to know which skills are really important so that you can focus on those skills and show that you have those skills through discussion. 

### To show your communication skill
Then you can show that you can communicate well.
If you can do a good discussion, they will immediately know that you can work with people and that your communication skill is good. Communication is key in professional life. If you are highly skilled, but your communication is terrible, you will not be able to do a good job most of the time! Because in your professional work, you will do a lot of discussion with people. You have to think about different solution approaches, you will have to talk with people, tell your idea. You have to work together with people. Through the discussion, you can show you have those skills. 

### To know more about the company and your future colleagues.
Another purpose is to know more about the company and your future colleagues. 
**I have seen that many people join a company, then after a couple of months, they feel very disappointed, because they didn't like the job!
To avoid this situation, before joining a company, you should ask yourself,** _"Is this project right for my career?"_

Everyone has a career purpose, and you have to think ahead of your career. If you join a team that is not aligned with your career trajectory, joining this team can hamper your career. If the company is not suitable for your career goal, then joining this company will hamper your career. 

So you have to ask yourself, "Is this company right for me? Is this team right for me? Is the project right for me?" 
But, how can you know these? You have to **Interview the interviewer!**

### Interview the interviewer!
 
During the interview, you should ask various questions to the interviewer. And based on the answers he gives to your questions, you can understand what they are doing, how they're doing it, and if the company and the project or the team match your career trajectory. 

Here, I'm also interviewing my interviewer. I'm also trying to understand:
- How he works 
- how his team works
- how smart they are
- what the project is about
- what my role will be in the project
- Does the work culture of this team matches my working style
- Do they care about the quality? 
- Will I enjoy working with them?

These are very important. Why? Because this discussion will help you decide whether you will join the company or not. 
You will be in the office eight hours a day? That means you will spend one-third of your time with these people. So you have to really find out whether you will enjoy working with them or not. 

### To know if there is something that you don't like to do
For example, you may not like to do administrative work. In that case, you can ask, 
"How much administrative work will I have to do? Or how much time do I have to spend every day on administrative work?"
