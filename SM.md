How do I take preparation before a job interview.
At first I sort out the important skills required for this job.

Then I divide those skills in 3 categories:
- Technical/core skills
- Soft skills
- Domain knowledge

Then throughout the interview:
- I show various examples that how I possess those required skills
- If you don’t have one skill, then I tell what is my motivation to learn that

A day before a job interview, I wondered what I should say regarding my project works!

I know that I did a lot, but I can't remember what exactly I did to solve a problem 1 year ago!

I know which technologies I use and what my role is, but if anyone asks me what exactly I did or goes into deep discussion, I will be in trouble because I can't remember many details!

**I know a lot of people have the same problem.**

**That's why I follow this experience matrix;** it helps me to gather all the ideas, all the things I did, and all the skills I acquired in different dimensions, e.g. technical skills, soft skills, and domain knowledge.

I gave it as an exercise in my course.

## Tell Me About Yourself in a job interview: Mistakes to avoid and how to tell like an expert
The 1st question in a job interview is: "Tell me about yourself."
IMO, if you can tell about yourself very well, 50% of your job is done in the interview. You have set the tone, now can navigate the interview, and you will have high confidence and no nervousness. 

### Mistakes to avoid:
However, many people make a big mistake; they just mention their name, where they are coming from, and where they studied, only this kind of information. That's wasting an opportunity!

### Show that you are a perfect match!
When talking about yourself in a job interview, you should create an impression that you are the perfect match for this position. 
You should strongly introduce yourself so that the interviewer understands that you are an ideal match for this job. And the interviewer will know that you will do an excellent job if you are hired!

To know more, either read my blog or enroll in my course!

Many people wanted to know how I tell about myself in a job interview.
After I pointed out some mistakes people make while telling about themselves and how they are wasting an opportunity, it created awareness. That's good : )
I have also given some tips regarding what to tell about yourself in my blog and my course.

In my course, I have created a video explaining how do I tell about myself.

I have also created 2 templates that are ready to use.
One template is for the freshers; another is for the people with more experience (for both mid-level and experienced candidates).
You can simply download the template from my course and prepare your "Tell me about yourself."
Remember, IMO, 50% of your job is done in the interview if you can tell about yourself very well.

Freshers asked me how they can tell about themselves in a job interview, as they don't have industry experience!
No worries! Today I will show how freshers can tell about themselves in a job interview.
When I was a fresher, I didn't know how to tell about myself in the right way and wasted a lot of opportunities! I only used to tell my name, where I come from, my university, etc. 
But, You should strongly introduce yourself so that the interviewer understands that you are an ideal match for this job. 

Below is a template I encourage freshers to use:
