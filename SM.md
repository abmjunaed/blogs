These are the 5 parts of my Framework to "Ace a Job Interview".
I have written a blog explaining these steps, link in the comment.

How do I take preparation before a job interview.
At first I sort out the important skills required for this job.

Then I divide those skills in 3 categories:
- Technical/core skills
- Soft skills
- Domain knowledge

Then throughout the interview:
- I show various examples that how I possess those required skills
- If you donâ€™t have one skill, then I tell what is my motivation to learn that

The day before an interview, I wondered what I should say regarding my project works!

I know that I did a lot, but I can't remember what exactly I did to solve a problem 1 year ago!

I know which technologies I use and what my role is, but if anyone asks me what exactly I did or goes into deep discussion, I will be in trouble because I can't remember many details!

**I know a lot of you have the same problem.**

**That's why I follow this experience matrix;** it helps me to gather all the ideas, all the things I did, and all the skills I acquired in different dimensions, e.g. technical skills, soft skills, and domain knowledge.

I gave it as an exercise in my course.
