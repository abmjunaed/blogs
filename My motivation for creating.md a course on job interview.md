My motivation for creating a course on job interview: **to empower you** _so that you don't make the same mistakes I did and you don't get frustrated like me._

**I failed many job interviews, although I had all the required qualifications.**
I became very frustrated and clueless!  

**I know this resonates with a lot of you. **

Afterward, I thought a lot and investigated what the problems were.
I figured out that many things are very important during a job interview on top of your skill set and qualifications.
